# JSP Page with Recommendation Based on Day time

 Dear students,

Please create the JSP page which will contain HTML code and "if-else" conditions based on day time.

For instance,

1) if current date time is less than 12 PM, HTML page should recommend to have a breakfast

2) if current date time is more or equal than 12 PM and less or equal than 16 PM, page should recommend to have a lunch

3) if current date time is more than 16 PM, page should recommend to have a dinner/supper
